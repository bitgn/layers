* Event Store Layer

Event store layer is an implementation of append-only log which also
maintains indexes all messages by their stream name. It is frequently
used to implement _Aggregates with Event Sourcing_ pattern.

This design document outlines Event Store version 1, without any
optimizations to reduce storage space.

** Key ranges

We designate following key ranges:

| Prefix | Description                   |
|      0 | Settings for this Event Store |
|      1 | Global append-only log        |
|      2 | Stream storage                |

** Methods 

*** AppendToStream

Arguments:
- stream name (string)
- stream version (long) - expected stream version, -1 to skip version check
- events (list of byte[]) - message values

*** ReadFromStream

Arguments:

- stream name (string)
- starting from (long)
- max count (int)

returns: list of stream data

*** ReadAll

Arguments:

- starting from (long)
- max count (int)

returns: list of stream data

*** GetStoreVersion

Returns: store version (long)
