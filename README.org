* Event Store Layer

Event store layer is an implementation of append-only log which also
maintains indexes all messages by their stream name. It is frequently
used to implement _Aggregates with Event Sourcing_ pattern.

Key requirements:

- large messages are split into chunks;
- global stream and event streams are changed within a single
  transaction;
- Events within a stream are stored by an incrementing version number;
- Events in the global stream are stored by the version stamp.

Global event range 

This design document outlines Event Store version 1, without any
optimizations to reduce storage space.

** Key ranges

We designate following key ranges:

| Prefix | Description                                                   |
|      0 | Settings for this Event Store                                 |
|      1 | All events ordered by the version stamp                       |
|      2 | Events stored by streams and ordered by version within stream |

** Methods 

*** AppendToStream

Arguments:
- stream name (string)
- stream version (long) - expected stream version, -1 to skip version check
- events (list of byte[]) - message values

*** ReadFromStream

Arguments:

- stream name (string)
- starting from (long)
- max count (int)

returns: list of stream data

*** ReadAll

Arguments:

- starting from (long)
- max count (int)

returns: list of stream data

*** GetStoreVersion

Returns: store version (long)







* Language-specific implementations

** .NET

.NET Methods are to be implemented as ~async~ returning ~Task~ and
accepting ~CancellationToken~ as the last optional parameter.
